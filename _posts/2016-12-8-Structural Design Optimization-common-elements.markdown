## Overview
<p>The term project was taught by Prof. Paulino from Geogia Tech. We used structural optimization technique for a structure that has smaller cross section on the bottom and larger cross section on the top. We were also honored to have the structural engineer of the tallest structure in the world: Bill Baker to gave a presentation in the class.</p>
