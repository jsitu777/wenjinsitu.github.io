## Overview
<p>The term project was taught by Prof. Paulino from Georgia Tech. We used structural optimization technique for a structure that has smaller cross section on the bottom and larger cross section on the top. My teammate and I implemented a stiffness compliant method under gravity loads with MATLAB for the project.</p>
