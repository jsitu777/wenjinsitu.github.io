## Overview
<p>5110 Telegraph is a 6 story multi-family project in Oakland. Its lateral system consists of Buckling Resisting Braced Frame and its gravity system utilizes pre-fabricated volumetric modules. </p>

<p>I was involved in the construction administration phase for the project, conducting weekly site visit, answering RFIs, and completing the deferred components of the design. The building has been topped out in Aug 2019. </p>
