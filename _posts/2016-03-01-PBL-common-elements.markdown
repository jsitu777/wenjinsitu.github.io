## Overview

<p>PBL is a global interdisciplinary design collaboration class in which the students from a diverse set of AEC disciplines at seven major universities collaborate to complete the design of an educational building in an intense two-quarter timeline. The design team conducted weekly meetings across different time zones. Students from the participating Universities co-located at Stanford in the final week and made their project presentation as a team.</p>

<p>As a structural engineer in the team, I completed two structural systems design for an L shape and a rectangular shape building, as well as their foundation design. I coordinated with our architect and implemented an exposed voronoi panel system with the use of grasshopper scripting.</p>
