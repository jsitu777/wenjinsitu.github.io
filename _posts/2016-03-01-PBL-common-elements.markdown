## Overview

<p>PBL is a global interdisciplinary design collaboration class in which the students complete the design of an educational building in an intense two-quarter timeline. The design team conducted weekly meetings considering different time zones. Students from European institutes came to Stanford in the final week and made the presentation as a team.  </p>

<p>As a structural engineer in the team, I completed two structural systems design for a L shape and a rectangular shape building, as well as their foundation design. I coordinated with the architect and implemented the exposed voronoi panel system with the use of grasshopper scripting.</p>
