## Overview
<p>2044 Franklin is a 30 story mixed used high rise in Oakland. Its lateral system consists of steel plate shear wall and its gravity system from level 6 utilizes pre-fabricated volumetric modules. The design process involves performance based design with a peer review panel, as well as full scale seismic testing. We completed the design into DD phase with a team of only three engineers. </p>

<p>I am responsible for designing the three stories adjacent townhome, as well as the foundations system for both the tower and the townhome. My colleague and I co-created a auto-clicking scripting with Python to automate P3D modeling effort. I am also involved in creating the structural analysis spreadsheet to check structural performance and steel tonnage in the design iteration process of the project.</p>
