## Overview
<p>2044 Franklin is a 30 story mixed used high rise in Oakland. Its lateral system consists of steel plate shear walls and its gravity system from level 6 utilizes pre-fabricated volumetric modules. The design process involved performance based design with a peer review panel, as well as full scale seismic testing. As a part of a vertically integrated startup with a team of only three engineers, we completed the design into DD phase. </p>

<p>I was also responsible for designing the three story adjacent townhome, and the foundations system for both the tower and the townhome. My colleague and I co-created an automated approach for Perform 3D modeling using Python to program GUI interaction, enabling rapid iteration. I was also involved in creating the structural analysis spreadsheet to check structural performance and steel tonnage in the design iteration process of the project.</p>
