## Overview
<p>This was a Stanford project to develop a computer tool in MATLAB to compute some quantitative measures of seismic performance such as the expected annual loss of the building with the implementation of performance based framework.</p>

<p>I successfully implemented the performance based risk analysis framework based on recent papers by Professor Jack Baker with MATLAB. </p>
